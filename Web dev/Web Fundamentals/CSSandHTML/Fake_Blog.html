        <p>In 1939, Lemann was born in Rio de Janeiro to Paul Lemann,[1] a Swiss immigrant who founded the dairy manufacturer, Leco, and Anna Yvette Truebner, a Brazilian of Swiss origin.[5][6][7] Lemann attended the American School of Rio de Janeiro.[8]

            His father died in a bus accident in 1953, when Lemann was 14.[9]
            
            In 1961, he received a bachelor's degree in economics from Harvard University. According to Lemann's own admission, he did not enjoy his time at Harvard, stating that "My first year at Harvard was horrible. I was only 17 and I missed the beach and the sun a lot. Boston was too cold for me. It was my first time in the USA and I was not used to study or to write; we have to write a lot in Harvard. My grades were the worst possible."[10][11] After setting off fireworks on the last day of his freshman year, he was reprimanded and considered dropping out, but ultimately decided to stay on.[10][12]
            
            Lemann always wanted to become an Inventor. As a kid he admired Thomas Edison. He built different machines but they usually did not work out. Lemann was also an avid tennis amateur. He won the Brazilian national tennis championship five times.[8][13] He participated in the Davis Cup twice, once as part of the Swiss Davis Cup team and once on behalf of the Brazilian team,[1][14] and also played at Wimbledon in 1962.[15]
